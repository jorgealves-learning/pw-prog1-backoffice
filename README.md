### Pedidos Model

*Pedidos* is a Model specifically made with the function to create a *Ticket Order* (indicated with `funcao criar_pedido(ticket)`) which is meant to `Print` a message with the order for each of the restaurants in the *shopping cart ticket* used by the Front Office.

The function returns the messages required and is then used by the Front Office scripts.
